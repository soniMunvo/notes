AWS Roadmap: Cloud Practitioner - Z)NX(BDmGLP7ArX


￼



>>>aws global network - (collection of region zones) -> (collection of availability zones)
If one of the A zones fails, it’s not gonna impact the other ones. 
we store and run our instances whichever is closest to us. 

>>>How prices work
Based on 3 fundamentals:
Compute - charged for amount of cpu and memory, and disk space 
Quantity of Data storage
Outbound data transfer (data uplaod is free but when we pull that data that is being charged)
A few less imp: pay-as-we-do, save when reserve, and pay less by using more

>>>Computation
EC2 instance is used in the same pod with other instances.
Dedicated host is a physical EC2 server. (can use existing server-bound licences) - more price.

>>>Login
Professional or Personal (personal in my case)
Sign in to Console - using either root user email or IAM user.		

>>>SNS(Simple Notification Service)
Lets you notified by simple http protocols (email)
create a new topic - name - endpoint is email address

>>>Root vs IAM user and IAM groups

Root user all access - great power - difficult to restrict usages
IAM - Identity and Access Management Service(IAM)
IAM  can be used by employees or services.
IAM policy - document - permission or set of rules. (X, y, z)
IAM GROUP - Assign policy to this group(CONTAINER) to delegate same permissions to all.

>>>Roles

>>>Authenticatin Methods
Access Key + API (via code or cmd)
Using UI(AWS management console) (IAM user + password + mgmnt console)

>>>IAM in deep
has a lot of permission we can chose to assign it to groups or users.
User - has denied access to Billing Service, rest all is the same.

>>>Amazon Virtual Private Cloud(VPC)
Region - VPC - Availability Zone(S) - public and private subnet(S)
Router is used to send info between different subnets using route table
0.0.0.0/0 represents everything else.  (Address like these will route requests via Internet gateway to internet)
CIDR: Classless Interdomain Routing


￼

>>>Subnets
Public Subnets - public ip -internet gateway - access internet directly

private subnets - can’t access internet directly.

>>>VPC in Mgmnt Console
Different subnets represents different availability zones
ip address here uses CIDR
PUBLIC SUBNET -> represents “auto-assign public ipv4 address” as Yes  
PUBLIC SUBNET -> should also be connected to internet gateway - 
 - CAN ALSO be conneted by any instance using IP


>>>Security Groups and Network Acccess Control Lists(NACLs)
Security Groups - instance level (EC1, EC2) | can be applied to any instances in any subnet.
NACL - applied at the subnet level.
Add new inbound/outbound rules as per our need. 
0.0.0.0/0 represents any address. over the internet for ipv4 and ::/0 for ipv6

>>>Stateful and Stateless Firewalls
In AWS, security groups is Stateful and NACL is stateless.

￼

Differences b/w security groups and NACL:
SG is at instance level while NACL is at subnet level
SG supports allow rules only while NACL supports allow and deny rules.
SG is stateful and NACL is stateless
SG evaluates all rules and then process. NACL processes rules in order
SG Applies to an instance while NACL applies to al linstances within the subnet. 

>>>Public and Private Services
￼

AWS cloud has private and public services:
VPC has private services. 
Still I can set the visibility of some services by keeping them into public or private subnets. 
For Ex: I want to connect Amazon S3 through EC2, then I have to go via INTERNET GATEWAY.
We have VPC-endpoint - we can connect to some services privately. (advanced topic)
