Configuration - if I change values in DB, setting won't be applied in backend. Change it using UI and check it using front-end < page source < network  < api call < modified value

OR use postman

Bearer token: contains username and info, kinda authentication mechanism (If I don't put token it's gonna give 401 error)

Tere are some invisible nodes becase in UI (in actual example) those are PARENTS.


>>>Tables
Configuration contains configuration properties
Flowchart contains flowchart nodes with parents
The options in UI for flowchart is in flowchart_options table.
Outbound_option contains every column for the options on the right side options on UI
Outbound_log contains responses when the action was performed.
	Input sent - what we send to lambda
	Output sent - what lambda sends to other api.
Session keeps sessions.(each parent and child actions' has different sessions)
	Session is tied to actions
	But if there no actions even then we create a session for that node.
	Why we do this? Bc the payload can change, so we see session to observe how the payload is changing.
Inbound is created when the condition statement goes true.
Gateway_user: users in db
RoleName: suggests role - user, admin, external
Menu_item: item options in UI on left side.
Persistent_token: instead of login every time and saving we can save them in this table. (modify them if necessary)
